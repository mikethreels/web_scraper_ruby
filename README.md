## Project description

It checks if the URL which is given is still up to date and it will return an error and exit the code if it's not.
When the URL has been checked and is correct the program will scrape the new arrived developer books from a webpage called 'Bol.com'.
After getting the information it will look for the articles on the page and if there are more pages with results.
It will get all the articles and return them requesting the user how they would like to view them.
